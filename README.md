`caladaptr` is an API client that makes it easier to work with data from
Cal-Adapt.org in R.

## Installation

Currently, caladaptr is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/UCANR-IGIS/caladaptr) in a private
repository. To install it, you need to i) be added to the repo as a
collaborator (contact Andy Lyons or Shane Feirer), and ii) generate a
[personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for
yourself. A personal access token is a bit like a password, which you
feed into the ‘install\_github’ as shown below.

    library(devtools)
    install_github("UCANR-IGIS/caladaptr", auth_token = "insert-your-token-here")
