## Features

`caladaptr` is an API client that makes it easier to work with data from [Cal-Adapt.org](https://cal-adapt.org/) in R. The niche of `caladaptr` is to bring data into R after which you can use other packages for analysis and visualization:

<p align="center"><img src="man/figures/caladaptr_role_480x432x256.png" width="480" height="432"/></p>

`caladaptr` allows you to:

- query any of Cal-Adapt's ~950 raster data layers
- retrieve values by point, a preset area-of-interest (e.g., census tract), or a user-provided polygon
- cache large queries in a local SQLite database
- download cropped rasters as TIFs and import them into R as stars objects

`caladaptr` functions have been designed to: 

- be pipe friendly 
- return tibbles for compatibility with tidyverse packages
- return values with encoded units (managed by the [units](https://cran.r-project.org/package=units) package)
- accept and return `sf` data frames where spatial objects are needed
- return rasters as spatiotemporal arrays ([`stars`](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) objects)

`caladaptr` does not support downloading the original NetCDF rasters nor station data (e.g., sea level rise, stream gauges). For these data, see the Data Download tool or FTP server on [Cal-Adapt.org](https://cal-adapt.org/data/).

\

## Installation

`caladaptr` is available on [r-universe](https://ajlyons.r-universe.dev/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. To install it, you can run:

```
options(repos = c(ajlyons = 'https://ajlyons.r-universe.dev',
                  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
install.packages('caladaptr')
```

Alternately, you can install it directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/ucanr-igis/caladaptr){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. (This requires the `remotes` package plus [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for Windows users.)

```
remotes::install_github("ucanr-igis/caladaptr")
```

If you are trying (and failing) to install `caladaptr` on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (or another Linux machine), try to install `sf` by itself, and then `caladaptr`.

```
if (!require(sf)) install.packages("sf")
options(repos = c(ajlyons = 'https://ajlyons.r-universe.dev',
                  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
install.packages('caladaptr')
```

## General Workflow 

In general, there are three steps to retrieving Cal-Adapt data with `caladaptr`:

1) Create an 'API request object'

2) Feed the API request into a function that fetches data (either values or rasters)

3) Wrangle the data that comes back into the format required for your analysis

## Example: Projected Annual Temperature at a Point Location

In this example, we'll get the projected maximum daily temperature for a point location near Sacramento, averaged by calendar year from 2040-2070, for 10 GCMs and 2 emissions scenarios. Then we'll plot them.

\

**1\. Create an API request object**

Creating an API request object is a bit like filling in an order form. The request is essentially a description of the data you want. 

There are a number of constructor functions you can mix and match to create an API request object. Below we create a request for 30 years of  projected annual average maximum daily temperature from the [LOCA downscaled CMIP5 climate projections](https://berkeley-gif.github.io/caladapt-docs/data-catalog.html) from Scripps, for a single point location.

```{r cap1_create, cache = FALSE}
library(caladaptr)

sac_tasmax_cap <- ca_loc_pt(coords = c(-121.4687, 38.5938)) %>%     ## specify a location
  ca_gcm(c("HadGEM2-ES", "CNRM-CM5", "CanESM2","MIROC5",            ## select GCM(s)
           "ACCESS1-0", "CCSM4", "CESM1-BGC", 
           "CMCC-CMS", "GFDL-CM3", "HadGEM2-CC")) %>%     
  ca_scenario(c("rcp45","rcp85")) %>%                               ## select emission scenarios(s)
  ca_cvar(c("tasmax")) %>%                                          ## select climate variables
  ca_period("year") %>%                                             ## select a temporal aggregation period
  ca_years(start = 2040, end = 2070)                                ## select start and end dates

sac_tasmax_cap
```

\

**2\. Fetch data**

Functions that **fetch data** from Cal-Adapt include `ca_getvals_tbl()`, `ca_getvals_db()` (see *Large Queries* vignette), and `ca_getrst_stars()` (see *Rasters Part I* vignette). Below we'll fetch data into a tibble by passing the API request to `ca_getvals_tbl()`:

```{r cap1_getvals, cache = FALSE}
sac_tasmax_tbl <- sac_tasmax_cap %>% ca_getvals_tbl(quiet = TRUE)
head(sac_tasmax_tbl)
dim(sac_tasmax_tbl)
```

\

**3\. Wrangle Data**

Depending what your goal it, you may need to add or delete columns, reshape the data, group rows, etc. Below we'll add a column for Fahrenheit using `set_units()` from the [`units`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=units) package.

```{r message = FALSE}
## Add a column with Fahrenheit units
library(dplyr)
library(units)
sac_tasmax_tbl2 <- sac_tasmax_tbl %>% mutate(temp_f = set_units(val, degF))
head(sac_tasmax_tbl2)
```

Now we can plot it:

```{r sac_tasmax_tbl2_plot, out.width = 600}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = sac_tasmax_tbl2, 
       aes(x = as.Date(dt), y = as.numeric(temp_f))) +
  geom_line(aes(color=gcm)) +
  facet_grid(scenario ~ .) +
  labs(title = "Annual Average Maximum Daily Temperature for Sacramento", x = "year", y = "temp (F)")
```

\

## Constructing API Requests

API request objects are constructed by stringing together functions that provide the key elements of the request, including the location(s), dataset(s), and time frame.


**Location functions** (pick one):

|Function             |Location Type|
|---------------------|-------------|
|`ca_loc_pt()`        | points in matrices|
|`ca_loc_aoipreset()` | preset areas-of-interest|
|`ca_loc_sf( )`       | user-supplied sf object (point or polygon)|


**Date functions** (pick one):

|Function             |Date Type|
|---------------------|-------------|
|`ca_dates()`|specific dates|
|`ca_years()`|years|

**Dataset functions** (pick one group):

|Functions            |Dataset|
|---------------------|-------------|
|`ca_gcm()` + `ca_scenario()` + `ca_cvar()` + `ca_period()`|LOCA downscaled modeled climate data (including all Scripps and VIC)|
|`ca_livneh()` + `ca_cvar()` + `ca_period()`|Livneh data (observed historical)|
|`ca_slug()`|Everything else|


`ca_example_apireq()` is a convenience function that returns sample API requests for testing. You can use `ca_preflight()` to check an API request for errors. Plotting an API request will show the location(s), with an option to overlay the loca grid cells:

```{r plot_samp_cap, out.width=360}
samp_cap <- ca_example_apireq(3)
samp_cap %>% ca_preflight()
plot(samp_cap, locagrid = TRUE, static = TRUE)
```

For more examples, including retrieving data for a preset area-of-interest (i.e., census tracts), see the *API Requests* vignette and 'R Notebooks' on the [website](https://ucanr-igis.github.io/caladaptr/). 

## Constants

To help you pass arguments for the various constructor functions, `caladaptr` provides the following constants:

```{r constants, cache = FALSE}
## Climate Variables 
cvars

## Global Climate Models
## Note: the first 4 are the 'priority' models recommended under California's 4th Climate Change Assessment.
gcms

## Emission scenarios
scenarios

## Temporal resolution periods
periods
```

## Data Catalog

`caladaptr` can not tell you which climate data you need for your project. Nor will it teach you how to use climate data appropriately or wisely. However it does have a copy of the Cal-Adapt raster series data catalog, so you can see what's available and specify the datasets you need.

To view the entire data catalog in a RStudio Viewer pane, run the following. You can then use the filter button to find datasets that match a key word.

```
View(ca_catalog_rs())
```

You can also search for datasets using `ca_catalog_search()`, and download a fresh copy of the catalog from Cal-Adapt using `ca_catalog_fetch()`.

Most / all of the Cal-Adapt rasters series have been downscaled to approximately 6km (3.7 mi) using the LOCA downscaling method, and are available for the coverage area shown below. For a finer scale analysis, you can download the LOCA grid cells as a polygon layer using `ca_locagrid_geom()`.
